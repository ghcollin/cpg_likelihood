# Installation

You will need to install the GNU Scientific Library (GSL).

If you use conda, you can install the GSL with:

    conda install -c conda-forge pkg-config gsl

If you use Ubuntu, you can use:

    sudo apt install libgsl-dev pkg-config

Then, install the CPG likelihood package with

    pip install git+https://github.com/ghcollin/cpg_likelihood.git
    
# Downloading

To download, use the following command to clone the repository and all submodules:

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ghcollin/cpg_likelihood.git

# Optional requirements

To use the `run_emcee` helper function, you will need to install the `emcee` package:

    pip install emcee

To use the `run_ptemcee` helper function, you will need to install the `ptemcee` package:

    pip install ptemcee

# Examples

A file with examples for setting up a model and running the `emcee` sampler is located in

    examples/model_construction.py

A file with examples for using the `dynesty` sampler and creating the `mu(epsilon)` function through integration, simulation or from detector Monte-Carlo is located in

    examples/mueps_construction.py

You will need to install the `emcee`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `corner` and `dynesty` packages to run these examples:

    pip install emcee scipy matplotlib corner dynesty

You can then run the examples by specifying an output PDF into which the posterior will be rendered:

    python3 model_construction.py test.pdf

# Current limitations

Only a single break for the differential source count function is currently implemented. Multiple breaks will be added in a future version.

# Dependencies

In addition to GSL, this library makes use of the Eigen C++ linear algebra library.
A recent development version of Eigen is linked into this repository though a git submodule, as the latest stable version does not include features required by this library.
A modified version of the exponential integral algorithm written by [Guillermo Navas-Palencia](https://gnpalencia.org) and described in [this paper](https://gnpalencia.org/research/GNP_Expint2017.pdf) is included in this repository. 
The algorithm has been modified to make it more numerically stable for this specific application, where catastrophic cancellation can occur when the source flux is small.
