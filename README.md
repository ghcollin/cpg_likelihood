# Downloading

To download, use the following command to clone the repository and all submodules:

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ghcollin/cpg_likelihood.git

# Installation

You will need to install the GNU Scientific Library (GSL).

# Dependencies

In addition to GSL, this library makes use of the Eigen C++ linear algebra library.
A recent development version of Eigen is linked into this repository though a git submodule, as the latest stable version does not include features required by this library.
A modified version of the expoential integral algorithm written by [Guillermo Navas-Palencia](https://gnpalencia.org) and described in [this paper](https://gnpalencia.org/research/GNP_Expint2017.pdf) is included in this repository. 
The algorithm has been modified to make it more numerically stable for this specific application, where catastrophic cancellation can occur when the source flux is small.
